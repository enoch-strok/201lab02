            <h1 class = "boldHeading"> About Me </h1>
                <p> My name is Enoch. I was born in Latvia (Speak Russian/Ukrainian, and basic Indonesian), immigrated when i was 2 to the us, served in the US Army, deployed overseas, worked in IT for 5 years, and excited to learn more with you all! My IT background is Solution Architecture for Small/Medium size businesses. The main goal was financial and operational reporting through Microsoft Power BI Reporting Services using the full Microsoft Stack (Azure, SQL, Power BI, MS Office, SharePoint, etc..). I learned how to code in DAX, M code, T-SQL, and had only a handful of exposure to other various scripting languages.

            <h1 class = "boldHeading"> Education History </h1>
                <p> I went to community college for 2 years and studied business but I didn't finish it because I got a high paying job in the IT field and decided to work instead of continue my education. I took only 2 classes online on Udemy because I had told one of my employers that we needed SQL in order to continue using MS Power BI (for reporting services), but that I needed training, because I didn't know how to use it yet. They agreed and paid for it and paid me to train. I then learned about Code Fellows and decided that this was the best fit for the direction that I'm going.

                </p>
            <h1 class = "boldHeading"> Work History </h1>
                <p> I have worked in the construction industry the last 5 years and starting from the first year, I kept ending up in the IT side of things. I then was paid by one of my employers to train on SQL, per my request, and gave a formal presentation on why we needed it, to all three of my bosses (company owners). It was a success. Since then I have worked on an even bigger project, full stack analytics reporting using the MS stack. Both employers have now become my clients per their request and I have either done more work or have planned work with them in the near future.

                </p>
            <h1 class = "boldHeading"> Goals </h1>
                <p> My goal, in my career, is to build a very effecient and effective project and task management web app, primarily targeting the construction industry. The ideas I have in creating it, are based on 5 years of experince in the IT side of the construction industry. I've reviewed and live demo'ed countless software and then implimented and trained my clients' staff on how to use it. Most of these web apps or windows programs have missing basic features or are terribly organized and hard to understand or practically use.
